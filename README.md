## 💡 Project Overview

Investing through SIPs is one of the most popular ways to grow wealth systematically. This calculator helps users quickly estimate:

- Total invested amount
- Expected returns

All calculations are done using the **SIP formula**:

FV = P × [((1 + i)^n – 1) / i] × (1 + i)

Where:

- **FV** → Future Value (Final Investment Value)  
- **P** → Monthly Investment Amount  
- **i** → Monthly Interest Rate (Annual Rate ÷ 12 ÷ 100)  
- **n** → Number of Payments (in months)
